        <h1 class="center-text">Categorizing and the Question of Inclusion</h1>
        <p>How do we draw the lines for who gets counted? This is one of the most important questions when it comes to
            counting, and the answer is enviably political. The choices of who gets included into a count can have
            significant impacts on the resulting numbers and the politics surrounding them.
        </p>
        <p>One of the inherent complexities of counting is that it requires us to set boundaries on what we count, in
            other words, categorizing. But how do we even know what we're trying to measure is categorizable? How do we
            set boundaries that are useful? If we make them too inclusive then we over count and if we make them too
            restrictive we will under count.</p>

        <p>Let's take the example of how race gets counted in America. The US Census takes place every ten years and
            tries to count every single person living in the United States. During the Census, people will fill out a
            form that asks them some basic questions, one of which is to identify their race. This data is used to track
            racial disparities in health, income, housing and more. However, by limiting the options that people can
            choose for their race, the Census Bureau is making a choice. One that might not reflect the realities of
            people's lives.</p>
        <p>Recently, there has been some discussion of adding an option on the Census to identify as Middle Eastern and
            North African (MENA). The very fact that there is a question about whether to add this option clearly
            signifies that numbers are not wholly objective. People who support the new category say that the options
            presented do not encapsulate the challenges they face. Many people who identify as MENA may look white, this
            may mean that they do not suffer from the same levels of prejudice as African Americans, should they put
            African American or White? This ambiguity means that often they are not properly or consistently counted.
        </p>
        <p>Are we over counting white Americans? Anecdotally, many people who would otherwise identify as MENA identify
            as white on the census, but
            ironically, we lack the data to know the true impact of this potentially missing category. This is the
            paradox of counting, in order to know what our categories should be, what boundaries we should set we seem
            to have to already know everything our data could tell us.</p>
