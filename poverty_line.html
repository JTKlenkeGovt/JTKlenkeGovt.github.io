        <p>One of the most important things that the US Census Bureau does every year is setting the federal poverty
            line (FPL). This number is used by dozens of government agencies and thousands of non-governmental
            organizations
            (like your local homeless shelter or food bank) to determine how to distribute resources. The metric also
            provides a value to track over time and see how policies or other factors effect poverty over time.
            Ultimately, this number is used to count the number of people in poverty.</p>
        <p>But remember just because someone showed you a number doesn't mean it tells the whole story. The federal
            poverty
            line is ultimately arbitrary and doesn't take into account important factors like geographic location, cost
            of living and more. There are other measures of poverty that consider
            those factors (like the Cost of Living Index or Purchasing Power
            Parity) but for now we'll keep things simple and just look at the FPL for single
            individuals. This is worthwhile because lots of federal polices tie benefits to an individuals income as a
            percentage of the FPL, examples include Children's Health Insurance Program, the National School Lunch
            Program and Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Alright, now that we know a bit about the FPL and its potential effects. Let's try to set it ourselves! Below
            is a graph that tells us the number of people making an income that falls into certain brackets. This data
            comes from the 2020 US Census. Each bar represents a yearly income bracket in increments of $2,500. That
            means
            that roughly 12.5 million people make less than $2,500 a year.</p>
        <p>Drag the slider below the graph to choose a value for the FPL. Once you're happy with the value, click
            "Confirm Choice" to see the affects of your decision!</p>

            <p> At least on paper. Remember all those government
                agencies and non-governmental organizations that rely on this information? Unfortunately, the metric is
                now useless. Maybe try a different value?</p>

            <p>This is Matthew Davis, he is a 61 year old disabled Army veteran. While he does receive veterans
                benefits, he is unable to work full time and has an annual income of just over $6,000. Under the Total
                Disability Individual Unemployability (TDIU) rating, disabled veterans are limited in the amount of paid
                work
                they are allowed to do. Getting a job while you’re on TDIU can be
                grounds for the Veterans Affairs Services (VAS)
                to revoke your benefits. VAS permits veterans to earn up to the federal poverty line for one person.
                Unfortunately, now that value is so low that Matthew is must either stop working or loose his benefits.
                This gives him no choice but to end his employment.</p>
            <p>Because of this lowered poverty line, Matthew will lose thousands of dollars of wages and be unable to
                contribute to his community with paid work. The lower poverty line has made him more reliant on
                government services and prevented him from contributing to the workforce in any capacity.
            </p>
            <p>Is it fair for the federal poverty line to be below $5000 a year? The USDA's lowest-cost plan for food
                is almost $3,000 a year and the national average amount spent on food is more than $5,000. Does it
                really seem reasonable that spending about 60% of your income on food doesn't put you in poverty? What
                about housing?</p>

            <p>This is Lauren Brown, she is a 34 year old single mother living in who is pregnant with her second
                daughter. She works at Costco and makes about $20 an hour. She works nearly full time and struggles to
                pay for child care. She relies on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to ensure she and her
                family have enough to eat. The cutoff for eligibility is 130% of the federal poverty line. Two year ago,
                when she was making $18 an hour, she qualified for the program. But now that she makes more than $20,000
                a year, she no longer qualifies for the program. That means that even though Lauren is struggling to pay
                rent and feed her family, she no longer receives SNAP benefits.</p>
            <p>The problems that Lauren faces are widespread among low and middle income Americans. Many would consider
                $20+ an hour to be a good wage, and comparatively speaking, it is. However, despite getting a higher
                paying job Lauren finds herself worse off than she was before because she lost so much in benefits. This
                is what many people call the "wellfare trap" where people are incentivised to stay on welfare programs
                because earning more money would mean they no longer qualify for benefits and worse off than before.</p>
            <p>Is setting a federal poverty line and tieing benefits to this number strengthening this trap? Is it
                possible that the very existence of this number to measure poverty is making it worse?</p>

            <p>This is Nick Thompson, he is 28 years old and works part time as a graphic designer making around
                $25,000 a year. However, his parents are millionaires who often cover his rent or finance his expensive
                hobbies.
            </p>
            <p>Does he deserve to be categorized as a person in poverty? He has essentially no risk of
                becoming homeless or not being able to afford food. Is income too 1-dimensional to measure something as
                complex as poverty? Maybe deciding on one single number to encapsulate poverty is an impossible task.
                But
                is it useful?</p>

            <p>This is Thomas Horton and his wife, Pamela Mudge they live near Pittsburgh, they make a little
                more than $40,000 a year. Mr. Horton, 38, and a teenage son receive disability benefits, and Ms. Mudge
                works part time so she can assist with his care for a bone disease that has required several back
                operations. However, despite being near the median income for working adults and comfortably above the
                poverty line. Their family still struggles to provide even basic luxuries to their kids.</p>
            <p>After receiving tax credit payment ofr $750 a month from the expanded child tax credit, they were able to
                break twice from their frugal norms.</p>
            <p>One was a trip to Walmart, to quiet their classmates’ taunts over their thrift-shop clothes. Another was
                the family’s
                first vacation — a single night in a state park, where they pitched a borrowed tent and made s’mores. “I
                saw a happiness
                in my wife and kids I hadn’t seen in a long time,” he said. “I felt like father of the year.”</p>
            <p>Source New York Times.</p>

            <p>Is this family living in poverty? If they are living in a situation where they cannot afford even a
                single vacation or clothes that keep their kids from being teased at school are they doing well?</p>

            <p>As you've chosen it, the federal poverty line is set above the median income for working single
                Americans. Are more than half of working Americans living in poverty? Maybe, but if so, it doesn't seem
                like a particularly useful metric. If we want to classify those living in poverty as especially
                deserving of aid, then labeling more than half of people isn't particularly useful, which is the
                ultimate goal of deciding on a poverty line.</p>
