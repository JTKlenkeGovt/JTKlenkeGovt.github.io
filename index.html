        <p>One of the most important decisions in the process of policy making is deciding how to measure the effects of
            the policy. This might at first seem like an innocuous task. While it might be hard to collect good data,
            once its collected we'll have all our answers and know exactly what is happening with the thing we're
            measuring. Right?</p>
        <p>On the other hand, we know that scrupulous politicians are prone to lie and mislead with statistics. Just
            look at <a class="link"
                href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reagans-economic-policies-then-vs-today-1502403519">this
                famously misleading graph</a> or <a class="link"

                bus</a>. But even in the best of circumstances, with the best intentions, counting things can be hard.
            Deborah Stone, a pioneer of political science, argues that the act of counting and the numbers they produce
            are an inherently political. This means all the messiness and disagreement inherent to politics
            apply to numbers as well.
        </p>
        <p>You will see that through the act of counting, there are thousands of little decisions, dials that are
            turned, sliders that are moved, that create downstream effects. You will see how the manipulation of numbers
            is the norm, not the
            exception. To gain an understanding of numbers, explore this website and see how moving the
            hidden sliders behind the policy process can affect your life. </p>

                <h2>Numbers Categorize</h2>
                <p>One of the unseen effects of counting is to label and categorize. To perform even the most simple
                    data collection, people, events, identities and problems have to be categorized.</p>

                <h2>Numbers Normalize</h2>
                <p>Through the act of counting, we begin to normalize a problem or state of the world. "Measuring any
                    phenomenon inherently creates norms about how much is too little, too much or just right." -Deborah

                <h2>Numbers Simplify</h2>
                <p>Numbers simplify the complexities of the real world into just a few or even just one number that must
                    necessarily lack nuance.</p>

                <h2>Numbers Lie</h2>
                <p>Through their inherent ambiguity numbers can lie and mislead. Numbers are constantly part of a
                    political struggle to explain an phenomenon or provide an interpretation.</p>

                <p>After learning about some of the ways that numbers are political, let's see if you can do any better?
                    By choosing just one number we can see the effects that are had on data collection, policy and
                    people's lives.</p>
