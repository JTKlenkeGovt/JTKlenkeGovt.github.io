        <h1 class="center-text">Exploiting Ambiguity: How Numbers Lie</h1>
        <p>Despite how solid and unchallengeable numbers appear to be, they aren't. They are inherently political and
            thus can be molded to help the politician argue their point. Numbers convey a sense of expertise to those
            who use them and are a powerful tool of persuasion. In Deborah Stone's Policy Paradox, she gives the example
            of a voter enamored with Mitt Romney's use of numbers, "It was amazing. I mean, he didn't just make claims.
            He backed them up with graphs."

            In this famous picture of Ronald Reagan, he displays a graph that clearly shows his tax policy against his
            opponents. How can you argue with that? Clearly if you support "their bill" your taxes will skyrocket!
            Of course in reality, that graph has no numbers to it, the axis have no values. And yet it still provides
            the sense that he knows what he's talking about. That his policies must be backed up with hard, indisputable
            facts.

        <p>In another instance of politicians using numbers of questionable legitimacy to lend their argument additional
            credence is Boris Johnson's pro-Brexit bus. While the figure was in some sense "technically correct" it was
            heavily misleading. First, it ignored a rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher (more than 20 years
            earlier)
            which brought the membership fee down. Additionally, the figure ignores any funds that come from the EU to
            the UK. In some cases the EU directly gives funds back to UK countries. In short, this bus takes a
            complicated economic relationship and simplifies it to one number that is used to tell a story. This is a
            key demonstration of how numbers are inherently political tools.</p>
