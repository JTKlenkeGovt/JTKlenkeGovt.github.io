        <h1 class="center-text">Simplifying a Complex World</h1>
        <p>Fundamentally, the power of numbers is how they simplify and discretize an infinitely complex world. While
            this is what makes numbers so useful, it is also the source of confusion. When presented with a number,
            knowing how that number was obtained is pivotal in understanding it. If our numbers came from a survey, how
            can we know its representative? Furthermore, survey questions can be confusing, can lead the participant
            towards an answer or simply be ignored. How can we be sure that any number of metric that are measured
            through surveys are truly measuring the thing they are trying to measure?

        In the 1979 case Roe v. Wade, the supreme court took the contentious issue of abortion into two numerical
        "interests" a pregnant woman's interest's in her own life, and the state's interests. By simplifying this
        complected topic, the Justice was able to argue that there is a need to balance these interests. This means that
        by turning the complexities into numbers to be compared and balanced, the court simplified the world.
