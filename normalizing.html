        <p>When we decide to measure something, we typically want to compare it to something. If the type of measurement
            is truly revolutionary, like the Census in the early 1800s or measuring unemployment in the early 1900s,
            then the statistics have no baseline. This is a double edged sword. When numbers are viewed without
            comparison, then they are lacking necessary context. However, when they are presented in context numbers can
            begin to normalize something that shouldn't be taken for granted.

        <p>One example of this is food insecurity among children. The USDA, who provides food insecurity data, defines
            food security as "The ready availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods.
            Assured ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways (that is, without resorting to
            emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies)." While this is by no means an
            unchallengeable definition, it is the one we have data for.</p>
        <p>If we look at the number of food insecure children, we see that it is around 10% for all households and
            20-25% for Hispanic and Black households. This has been the case for a long time, nearly 20 years. It might
            be perfectly reasonable to look at the data, though a comparative lense, and say that the numbers are
            improving.
            A politician might focus on how they are trending downwards and congratulate themselves for contributing to
            that trend.</p>
        <p>
            However, another equally valid perspective is that having nearly 1 in 10 children and 1 in 5 black or
            hispanic child be food insecure in the richest country on earth, where nearly 60 million tons of food is
            thrown away each year, is morally indefensible. There is a legitimate argument to be made that having these
            long running statistics blinds us to horrors of what the statistics mean. This is what Stone means when she
            says that numbers can normalize. That by taking away the human element and simply putting a number to a
            problem, we can lose some of the urgency needed to make significant change. In that way, numbers can
            normalize horrific conditions by changing our frame of reference. A rate of child food insecurity of 10% can
            look incredible when considered in comparison to one of 15%.
